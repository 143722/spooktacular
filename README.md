It's that time of year again! Welcome to my 2021 Hacktoberfest Repository.

## How to Participate
This year we'll be creating monsters. JSON monsters! Fork this repository and make a pull request for each of your monsters.

0. Register your GitHub account with the Hacktoberfest event:

1. Fork this Repo.
2. Create a new JSON file named after your monster.
    * Example: frankenstein.json
3. Write valid JSON describing your monster.
4. Commit your changes.
